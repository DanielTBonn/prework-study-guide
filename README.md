# Coding Notes Webpage

## Description

In an effort to retain knowledge learned during my time as a student in this coding bootcamp, I have created a simple study guide webpage that will host important notes. As I built this project, I picked up a few basic principals of 4 different technologies such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This webpage contains a formatted structure to easily look up key facts and important notes related to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I have also added JavaScript functionality to the webepage in case the user is unsure of what to study. Using google chrome, open Chrome DevTools and you will see what our JavaScript function has picked out for the user at the bottom of the console log.
